# loi-mv-simulation

## About
This application tries to simulate self-made 3D-printed robots of the University of Rostock.
These are based on the micro:bit. For programming the robots there is a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eschaetz/loi-mv-sek1) on which this application on many places depends on.
For a better understanding of how to run, use, and develop this application you can read the German "[Anleitung](Anleitung.pdf)".

## Project setup
If you just want to run the loi-mv-simulation, there is a [dockerfile](dockerfile) for easy handling and starting the application.
